🔴 Project Name : ESP32 LoRa Sensor Monitoring with Embedded Web Server

<br  />

📷 About Project -   

🚩   In this project, you’ll build a sensor monitoring system using a TTGO LoRa32 SX1276 OLED board that sends temperature, humidity and pressure readings via LoRa radio to an ESP32 LoRa receiver.  
🚩   The receiver displays the latest sensor readings on a web server.  
<br  />

📜 Parts Required  

1. Arduino LoRa MKRWAN1300  
2. TTGO LoRa ESP32 OLED Development Boards – 2 Nos  
3. BMP280 – Temperature and Atmospheric Pressure Sensor module  
4. DHT22 - Temperature and Humidity Sensor  
5. 0.96” OLED Display module

Important Notes  

-- Versions of Libraries may get outdated with time.  

-- Download your libraries from their updated source repositories, to avoid any errors.  

-- This vesrion of code worked correctly with the libraries given in repo [At the time of upoad].  

-- Project source Code may needs to be changed if there big changes occured in library source codes.
